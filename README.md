# NOTES

Spatial Intelligence Framework is a project started by some students during a school project imposed by the Mathematics Departement of the National Institute of Applied Sciences of Rouen, France.
It aims to provide a templates-based, ANSI-C++ compliant computation library in order to design and implements artificial intelligences methods in the purpose of solving combinatorial problems in the field of constrained spatial optimization.
